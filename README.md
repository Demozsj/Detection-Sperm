Introduction to data Sets:
	This data set consists of three parts:  Subset-A provides more than 125,000 objects with bounding box annotation with category
	information of 101 videos for tiny object detection tasks; Subset-B segments more than 26,000 sperms in 10 videos as
	ground truth (GT) for tiny object tracking tasks; Subset-C provides more than 125,000 independent images of sperms and
	impurities for tiny object classification tasks.
Download the way:
	This is just a simple example of a data set due to github's limited data volume, which can be downloaded from XXXX.
Use requirement:
	Any non-commercial research work is welcome to use the database.
